App Name: Moodify App Tagline: Spotify playlist recommendations based on your mood. Link to github repo: https://github.com/crencricca/moodify

Description: Our app asks the user for a few inputs on their mood, activities and genres of music that they like, and direct them to a corresponding Spotify playlist that best matches their input. We also have a brief preview of that playlist for the user to look at before they decide to go to it.

A list of how your app addresses each of the requirements (iOS / Backend): iOS: AutoLayout using NSLayoutConstraint. UICollectionView & UITableView. Use navigation (UINavigationController) to navigate between screens. Integrate an API - the Spotify API. A working UI.

Backend:

Databases for both Users who have logged in and Playlists of users (that also adds the current_user into the database with the spotify playlist name that resulted from going through the inputs of mood, genre, and activities.
